// Function to analyze resume against job description
const analyzeResume = async (resumeText, jobDescription) => {
  try {
    const prompt = `Analyze the provided resume against the job description and generate a detailed evaluation report.

    Input:
    Resume Text: "${resumeText}"
    Job Description: "${jobDescription}"

    Evaluation Guidelines:
    1. Skills Matching
        - First extract ALL skills from resume (both technical and soft skills)
        - Then extract ALL required skills from job description
        - For each skill found in resume:
          * Check if it appears in job description
          * Note the context and proficiency level mentioned
          * Consider skill variations (e.g., "React.js" = "ReactJS")
          * Mark as true if found in job description, false if not
        - List all skills from resume regardless of job description match
        - Ensure no skills are missed even if they don't match
        - Include proficiency level where mentioned in resume
        - Example: "Python for Data Structures" is different from "Python for Web Development"

    2. Content Evaluation
    - Identify gaps and irrelevant content
    - Penalize vague or unrelated experiences
    - Evaluate clarity and specificity of achievements
    - Check for quantifiable results and impact

    3. Project/Internship Analysis
    - Match projects strictly based on JD relevance
    - Evaluate technology stack alignment
    - Check implementation context
    - Verify outcome relevance

    4. Resume Quality Metrics
    - Grammar and professionalism (independent of JD)
    - Structure and formatting
    - Content organization
    - Action verb usage
    - Quantifiable achievements

    5. Enhanced Recruiter Tips Requirements:
    - Provide at least 5-7 detailed suggestions for improvement
    - Include specific formatting recommendations
    - Add industry-standard best practices
    - Suggest optimal word count range for each section
    - Include ATS optimization tips
    - Provide keyword placement strategies

    6. Words to Avoid Analysis:
    - Identify at least 10 weak or overused words/phrases
    - Provide stronger alternatives for each word
    - Include context-specific replacements
    - Flag buzzwords and clichÃ©s
    - Suggest industry-specific professional terminology

    7. Suggested Skills Enhancement:
    - List at least 8-10 relevant technical skills from JD
    - Include emerging technologies in the field
    - Suggest certification recommendations
    - Add relevant soft skills based on role
    - Include tool/platform proficiency requirements

    8. Project Rephrasing Requirements:
    - Provide 3-4 alternative versions for each project
    - Include quantifiable metrics in rephrasing
    - Add technical keywords from JD
    - Improve action verb usage
    - Enhance result orientation
    - Include impact metrics

    Scoring Guidelines:
    - JScore (0-100): Strict evaluation of JD alignment
      70-100: Excellent match with specific skills and experience
      40-69: Partial match with some relevant experience
      0-39: Poor match with significant gaps

    - GScore (0-100): Overall resume quality
      70-100: Professional, well-structured, clear achievements
      40-69: Decent structure, needs minor improvements
      0-39: Major improvements needed
